			<blockquote>
				<p><q>Throughout her internship, KJ demonstrated incredible initiative, strong interest in learning, and as our Managing Director of Strategy called it, 'innovative thinking'.  KJ's teaming abilities are highlighted by her enthusiasm and her natural personality traits, which allowed her to build authentic relationships with her fellow interns and those agency staff she worked with. Also of note are KJ's communications skills, which I believe to be vitally important to success in any endeavor.  When you speak with KJ, or read what she has composed, you will find her to be well thought out, clearly articulated, and engaging.</q></p>
